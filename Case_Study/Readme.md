**Scenario**<br>
I am working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.<br>
The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But ﬁrst, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.<br>
<br>
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to inﬂuence casual riders to become members?<br>

Moreno (Lily Moreno - The director of marketing and my manager) has assigned me the ﬁrst question to answer:<br> 

###  How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently?

My task is to produce a report with the following deliverables:
1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key ﬁndings
6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis
